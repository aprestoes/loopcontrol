# Loop Control (Video Section Loop)

[![CI Status](https://github.com/aprestoes/loopcontrol/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aprestoes/loopcontrol/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

## What It Does

**LoopControl** is a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets you loop custom sections of videos - not just from the beginning to end. A controller overlays all videos, letting you set a start and end point for the loop.

## Why Use It?

- ü™∂ Skip the fluff - loop just the part that you care about
- üßë‚Äçüç≥ Master that recipe, riff, or dance move by repeating important sections
- üîÅ Turn any video segment into a gif-like loop
- ‚å®Ô∏è Utilize the visual controller overlay or keybindings
- üî• Works on virtually any HTML5 video across Chrome and Firefox

## How?

All HTML5 videos will display a moveable and hideable controller that indicates if loops are currently toggled on or off. Here you can set the start and end times of the sections you want to loop.

You can also manually toggle LoopControl by right-clicking the video and selecting loop.

**Default Keybindings** (targets the last video controller you interacted with):
- <kbd>Q</kbd> - Set loop start
- <kbd>E</kbd> - Set loop end
- <kbd>R</kbd> - Toggle loop
- <kbd>H</kbd> - Hide controller

## Cross-platform Browser Support

Since 2024, Google deprecated Manifest V2 for Chrome extensions in favour of [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/what-is-mv3). So while Firefox supports both Manifest V2 and Manifest V3 extensions, Chrome will only support Manifest V3 moving forward. Among other changes, Manifest V3 was interfering with how Firefox prompted for required permissions. Therefore two different manifests exist in the `./manifests/` folder.

To switch manifest types before testing/building:
```BASH
npm run prepare:chrome # Copies Manifest V3
npm run prepare:firefox # Copies Manifest V2
```

Huge thanks to [Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed), the [Firefox fork](https://github.com/codebicycle/videospeed) (seemingly abandoned) and the more updated [gediminasel fork](https://github.com/gediminasel/videospeed-firefox) with a few helpful fixes. The loop UI and settings pages were adapted from these extensions.

# loopcontrol
Firefox/Chrome extension to loop specified sections of videos. (Otherwise known as Video Section Loop)
=======
# Loop Control (Video Section Loop)
## What does it do?
This extension loops user-specified sections of videos. Instead of looping just from the end back to the beginning of the video, you can loop between any two points. Create a gif-like effect just within your browser!

## Why?
Watching a cooking video/tricky guitar tutorial/play-of-the-game/awesome performance? Use Loop Control to only watch the parts you want.

## To-do
- [ ] Implement options page and settings
- [ ] On toggle off, remove event listener instead of checking for lc.settings.enabled in event listener
- [ ] Fix issue with constant buffering when section loop is short (<1 seconds)
- [ ] Implement hide controller
- [ ] Default loop start and end times
- [ ] Keybindings

## Credit
